# Applying Symbolic Regression to Predict Human Heart Rates using Co-occurrence Graph-based Representation on Twitter Tweets

### Introduction
Human emotional change usually leads to internal changes in the
human body, such as blood pressure and heart rate changes.
Emotional change can be reflected through human-generated
textual content. This study conducts the experiment through a
dataset containing 2040 pairs of heart rate and Twitter tweets,
collected from one 35-year-old participant. In the current stage,
this study establishes co-occurrence graph-based representation,
which can cover all possible emotional expressions, such as
explicit adjectives and nouns with emotional meanings, in
Twitter tweets. Node and edge features are generated by
constructing a context-document co-occurrence matrix. To
reduce the dimensionality of the feature data, a genetic algorithm
is utilized for feature selection. Symbolic regression is utilized
to find out a mathematical relationship between graph-based
features and human heart rate. Moreover, this study applies
network analysis to understand the power law behavior reflected
in the proposed graph-based representation. The selected
features are obtained from the genotype with the optimal fitness
score, after the training of the 1000 generations by the genetic
algorithm. The comparison of heart rate prediction shows that
LightGBM can achieve better performance than symbolic
regression. The future direction of this study is discussed based
on the results in the current stage.
